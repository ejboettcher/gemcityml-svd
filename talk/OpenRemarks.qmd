The format is:

* Social: ~ 30 min

If you witness a violation of our Code of Conduct, please notify us. Always feel empowered to say something and please escalate any concerns immediately to someone on the staff or leadership team or email help@gemcity.tech.

### Welcome Everyone

Our community members are our family. Come hang out with us to learn and collaborate on a wide range of technology topics. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind, especially on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or citizenship status. We are committed to creating a non-hostile meeting and event space for all.

### Treat Others & The Space With Respect

Respect and allow everyone to express their opinions, concerns, and needs. Listen with the intention to understand. Respect the privacy of everyone in our community.

Please pick up after yourself. Treat communal spaces with respect. If you move something, put it back. Leave the space as you found it or better.

Harassment also includes sexual harassment in any form such as teasing, jokes, innuendos, images, gestures, touching, grabbing, or giving gifts of a sexual or unwanted nature.

If someone tries to move on from the conversation, let them go. If someone explicitly tells you to leave them alone, then leave them alone. If you are unsure if your behavior is inappropriate, don’t do it. Always err on the side of making a comfortable environment based on the other person’s standards, not your own.
